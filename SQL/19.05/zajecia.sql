-- TYPES OF JOINS:
-- Cross join - Iloczyn kartezjaÅ„ski - returns all possible combinations of rows; no key relationship required
-- Inner join - returns records that have matching values in both tables
-- Outer join:
	-- Left join - returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
    -- Right join - returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
    -- Full join (not supported in MySQL) - returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
-- joins are more efficient than subqueries

-- CROSS JOIN
SELECT * FROM category CROSS JOIN language;

# or without join:

-- UNION
	-- combines result sets of two or more SELECT statements, removing duplicates (UNION) or keeping all rows (UNION ALL)
	-- UNION - removes duplicates
    -- UNION ALL - includes all rows
    -- use case: aggregate silimiar data from multiple queries with compatible structures

-- FULL OUTER JOIN
	-- returns all records from both tables, with NULLs for non-matching rows
    -- use case: combine rows from two tables, including all rows regardless of matches
